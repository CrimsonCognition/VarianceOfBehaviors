# VarianceOfBehaviors
a small project to demonstrate the idea that simple uniform probabilities of random walk actions, for reinforcement learning, may not be as effective as other implementations. This project demonstrates how the variance that matters is in the experiences, and small modifications to the random choice algorithm can create significant improvements..
